# VMware TKGI Workshop - Enterprise Kubernetes 
------------------------------------------------------------

## Technical Pre-Requisites
- You should be able to access:

    - https://zoom.us/test
    - https://solar-system.cfapps.io
    - [Workshop Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17AG0H2_zJNXWIP8ZOsXjjlPCPKwhskRTg5bgkRR4maI) Note: go ahead and add your name to the list.

### If using a Windows PC
- You will need to use [PuTTY](https://github.com/rm511130/Tanzu-PKS-Workshop/blob/master/PuTTY_and_SSH.md) to access a Ubuntu VM (public IP address) using a `.ppk` private-key file.
- To download [`fuse.ppk`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rm511130/Tanzu-PKS-Workshop/master/fuse.ppk) you can install and use [wget](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/gnuwin32/wget-1.11.4-1-setup.exe) in a PowerShell window.
```
help wget
cd ~\Downloads
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rm511130/Tanzu-PKS-Workshop/master/fuse.ppk -Outfile fuse.ppk
```
- If you rather not install [wget](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/wget.htm), you can simply click on [`fuse.ppk`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rm511130/Tanzu-PKS-Workshop/master/fuse.ppk) then cut-&-paste its contents to a local file in your Windows machine. The file must be named `fuse.ppk` and set to read-only mode.
- If you need help installing or using PuTTY with [fuse.ppk](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rm511130/Tanzu-PKS-Workshop/master/fuse.ppk) check these [detailed instructions](https://github.com/rm511130/Tanzu-PKS-Workshop/blob/master/PuTTY_and_SSH.md).
- If you successfully tested the access to the `ubuntu@user1.pks4u.com` VM, you are ready for the workshop.

### If using a ï£¿ Mac 
- You will need to SSH into a Ubuntu VM (public IP address) using a private-key `.pem` file
- Using a Terminal Window, execute the following commands to download `fuse.pem` and set the downloaded file to read-only mode:
```
cd ~/Downloads
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rm511130/Tanzu-PKS-Workshop/master/fuse.pem
chmod 400 ~/Downloads/fuse.pem
```
- You can now test whether SSH is working with the `fuse.pem` private key using the following command:
```
ssh -i ~/Downloads/fuse.pem ubuntu@user1.pks4u.com
```
- Please `exit` from the Ubuntu VM if your test was successful. You are ready for the workshop.


### If using Google Chrome or Firefox as your Browser

- Throughout this workshop you will be frequently asked to cut & paste commands from this github page to your terminal window.
- Consequently, the [CodeCopy](https://github.com/zenorocha/codecopy#install) browser extension for Firefox & Google Chrome can be a valuable add-on to have. 
- If installing add-ons does not infringing on corporate security policies, please go ahead and install CodeCopy.
